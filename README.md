# CoreMLCameraDetection
This is a project I created to learn more about Core ML and the different models available. Specifically, it uses the camera on your device and infers what the object that you're pointing at. There is a label that shows the inference and the confidence level of what it believes the object is in decimal format.

### Technologies
* Swift 
* AVKit
* Vision
* ResNet50
* SqueezeNet

### Features
* User can use the camera on their device, point at any object and Core ML will infer what they think the object is.
* UILabel is provided below the camera so you can see what Core ML infers about the object. 
* UILabel also shows confidence level in decimal format with 100 being the absolute. 


### Disclaimer
CoreMLCameraDetection is a personal project created to learn and practice iOS development. It is currently open source to use as a resource for CoreData and Swift development.
